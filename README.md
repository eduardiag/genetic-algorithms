# Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains my personal experiments and learning journey with **Genetic Algorithms**.

Each folder explores a different problem or variant â€” from basic implementations to classic optimization problems like **TSP** and **Job Scheduling**.

The goal is to understand how GAs work, test different configurations, and analyze solution quality, convergence behavior, and optimality.

Work in progress, mostly for self-study and experimentation.
